### **Description & Fundamentals**

My submission for the final stage of the "Spots" project for Sprint 9. Cards, profile info and the avatar are now all sent to and from the server. Confirmation popups are now present when going to delete a card. All previous validation still works. New elements have been styled to align with the Figma design.

### **Technology & Techniques**

Several classes, ids and variables throughout the project have been renamed to keep more consistent naming conventions.

## Project Pitch Video

My project pitch video for Spots final stage. (Recorded on OBS instead of Loom because of techincal issues with Loom.) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ssKF8TNyUS07wG4TCgKMXddu8om55Ywb/view?usp=drive_link
(Video made before AI review and Code review fixes)

## Post Review Notes

- Most grid elements are now gone and replaced with flexbox properties, margin properties or padding in one case.
- Validation reset has been added on closing edit profile modal. (Button is always enabled while valid. Never when invalid.)
