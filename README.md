**Description & Fundamentals**

My submission for the second stage of the Spots project for sprint 3. The page should function as expected and be reactive to different screen sizes.

**Technology & Techniques**

Most of the page consists of various grids with most elements having flexable values. Aspect ratio was used instead of the bottom padding trick for the images due to it's simplicity. One instance of flex was used for the header just to push the logo into position.

**Updates**

Planning to send the required video for the project as soon as the code itself has been reviewed and, if needed, fixed up.
