**Description & Fundamentals**

My submission for the fifth stage of the Spots project for sprint 4. The modals should be able to be filled out and smoothly transition between open and closed.

**Technology & Techniques**

Modal button and pop-up variables are kept near the top as a general grouping while the variables for input control are just below and seperated by which modal they go to. I've also decided to include some comment text in both the HTML and JS, just to help divide up some of the segments a bit better.

**Notes**

Struggled a bit with getting the inputs to update, but when asking Dot, it became quite obvious where I made a mistake. The rest was fairly straight forward.
