### **Description & Fundamentals**

My submission for the eighth stage of the "Spots" project for Sprint 5. Dynamic cards can be generated now with the "New Post" button. The like button now toggles on and off when clicked. A card delete button has been added with included functionality. Finally, the cards can be opened in a modal of their own to view their full size.

### **Technology & Techniques**

The HTML/CSS have been refactored a bit to further diversify the card icon classes into seperate like and delete classes. The "getCardElement" function to add, delete, and import data to new cards has been implemented into the JS code. Buttons and modals for the cards to be previewed have also been coded into the JS/HTML and styled in the CSS.

### **Notes**

Struggles: Honestly had more issues with the CSS styling than the JS. Whether it was removing the border of the inactive like button from the active state or just getting the like button to not be cut off by the button borders.

Possible features:

- Would like to add in options to close modals by clicking outside of them (possibly mobile only).
